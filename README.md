# ThreadPool

from https://github.com/progschj/ThreadPool

I just add some comments to make the code easier to understand, I also make some change to `example.cpp`, that's it.

To run the `example.cpp`, just run:

```shell
g++ -std=c++11 example.cpp -o main && ./main
```

or

```shell
g++ -std=c++11 example.cpp -pthread -o main && ./main
```

under the project directory.

It depends on your compiler and linker.
